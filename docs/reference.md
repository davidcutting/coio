# kioto Reference

This document describes the public API of **kioto**. It is intended to be a stable reference for headers under `include/kioto/`.

- **Language level**: C++20 (the library). `std::execution` is provided by an implementation library (P2300).
- **Scope**: kioto types and contracts. Standard `std::execution` algorithms are not re-documented here.
- **Platform**: Core types are portable; async I/O + networking backends are currently available on Linux and Windows.

## 1. Conventions

### Senders, awaitables, and composition

- Many kioto operations are **senders** (P2300). They can be composed with `std::execution` algorithms.
- `kioto::task<T, Allocator, Scheduler>` is both a coroutine type and a sender.
- Inside a `kioto::task`, you can `co_await` a sender (kioto wires sender-to-awaitable via `await_transform`).

### Stop tokens and cancellation

- Many async operations support cooperative cancellation by [stop token](https://eel.is/c++draft/thread.stoptoken).
- Cancellation follows the sender/receiver contract: cancellation completes with `set_stopped()`.

## 3. Core coroutine types

### 3.1 task

Header: `#include <kioto/exec/task.h>`

`kioto::task<T, Allocator, Scheduler>` is a **lazily-started, move-only coroutine type** that also models a **sender**.

**Properties**

- Move-only.
- Lazy: starts when awaited or when the sender operation state is started.
- Completion: `set_value(T)` (or `set_value()` for `T=void`), `set_error(std::exception_ptr)`, `set_stopped()`.
- Stop token: when awaited, the task inherits the stop token from the awaiting coroutine’s environment.

**Typical usage**

```cpp
auto foo() -> kioto::task<int> {
    co_return 42;
}

int x = co_await foo();

auto r = kioto::this_thread::sync_wait(foo());
```

**Notes**

- This reference intentionally does not document `std::execution::then/when_all/...` — see P2300.

### 3.2 generator

Header: `#include <kioto/exec/generator.h>`

`kioto::generator<Ref, Val, Allocator>` is a **synchronous generator** with lazy `co_yield`.
It is same as [P2502 - std::generator](https://wg21.link/p2502) in C++23, but works in C++20.

**Properties**

- Models `std::ranges::view_interface`.
- Single-pass input iteration.
- Supports recursive generation via `kioto::elements_of(range_or_generator)`.

**Example**

```cpp
auto fibonacci(std::size_t n) -> kioto::generator<int> {
    int a = 0, b = 1;
    while (n--) {
        co_yield b;
        a = std::exchange(b, a + b);
    }
}
```

## 4. Execution contexts

### 4.1 Thread-safety model

All execution contexts (`time_loop`, `epoll_context`, `uring_context` and `iocp_context`) share these guarantees:

- `run()` / `run_one()` can be called concurrently from multiple threads.
- `poll()` / `poll_one()` can be called concurrently from multiple threads.
- `get_scheduler()` is thread-safe.
- `request_stop()` is thread-safe.

Work submitted to the context may be executed by **any** thread currently calling `run()`/`poll()`.

### 4.2 time_loop

Header: `#include <kioto/io/execution_context.h>`

Execution context with a timer queue and a manually-driven event loop.

**Core operations**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `get_scheduler()` | returns a scheduler (models `std::execution::scheduler`) |
| `run()` | blocks and processes work until no work remains or stop is requested |
| `run_one()` | blocks and processes exactly one work item |
| `poll()` | processes all ready work without blocking |
| `poll_one()` | processes at most one ready work item without blocking |
| `request_stop()` | signals the context to stop processing |
| `work_started()` / `work_finished()` | manual work tracking (advanced) |

**Scheduler operations**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `schedule()` | returns a sender completing on this context |
| `schedule_after(duration)` | completes after duration |
| `schedule_at(time_point)` | completes at time point |
| `now()` | current time point |

### 4.3 epoll_context (Linux)

Header: `#include <kioto/io/driver/epoll_context.h>`

Execution context backed by **epoll**. Includes all `time_loop` APIs plus epoll-based async I/O.

### 4.4 uring_context (Linux)

Header: `#include <kioto/io/driver/uring_context.h>`

Execution context backed by **io_uring**. Includes all `time_loop` APIs plus io_uring-based async I/O.

### 4.5 iocp_context (Windows)

Header: `#include <kioto/io/driver/iocp_context.h>`

Execution context backed by **IOCP**. Includes all `time_loop` APIs plus IOCP-based async I/O.

### 4.6 work_guard

Header: `#include <kioto/io/execution_context.h>`

`kioto::work_guard<ExecutionContext>` is an RAII guard that increments the context work count and keeps `run()` from returning.

---

## 5. Waiting & kioto-specific algorithms

Header: `#include <kioto/core.h>`

### Synchronous waiting

- `kioto::this_thread::sync_wait(sender)`
- `kioto::this_thread::sync_wait_with_variant(sender)`

These block the current thread until the sender completes.

### kioto-specific algorithms

| Algorithm | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `when_any(senders...)` | completes when the first sender completes |
| `when_any_with_variant(senders...)` | variant-form result |
| `stop_when(sender, stop_token)` | attaches external cancellation to a sender |

---

## 6. Utilities

### 6.1 async_scope

Header: `#include <kioto/exec/async_scope.h>`

A [scope](https://wg21.link/p3149#introduction) object for spawning background work.

- `spawn(sender)`
- `request_stop()`
- `join()` → sender completing when all work finishes

### 6.2 timer

Header: `#include <kioto/base/timer.h>`

Timer bound to a scheduler.

- `async_wait(duration)`
- `async_wait_until(time_point)`
- `cancel()`

---

## 7. Async I/O utilities

Header: `#include <kioto/io/io.h>`

This header provides concepts and helper functions for `read`, `write`, and delimiter-based reads.

- `read(device, buffer)` / `write(device, buffer)`
- `async_read(device, buffer, token)` / `async_write(device, buffer, token)`
- `read_until(...)` / `async_read_until(...)`

---

## 8. Networking

Headers: `#include <kioto/net/...>`

> Networking backends are currently implemented only on Linux and Windows.

### Address and endpoint types

- `ipv4_address`, `ipv6_address`, `ip_address`, `endpoint`

### Protocol descriptors

- `tcp::v4()` / `tcp::v6()`
- `udp::v4()` / `udp::v6()`

### Socket types

Header: `#include <kioto/net/socket.h>`

- `basic_socket<Protocol, IoScheduler>`: open/close/bind/connect/options
- `basic_socket_acceptor<Protocol, IoScheduler>`: listen/accept
- `basic_stream_socket<Protocol, IoScheduler>`: read/write
- `basic_datagram_socket<Protocol, IoScheduler>`: send/recv, send_to/recv_from

### Concurrency rules

Be careful with the term "concurrency":

- **Concurrent calls** refers to *thread-safety*: two threads calling member functions on the same object at the same time.
- **Outstanding (pending) operations** refers to async operations that have been initiated and have not completed yet.

Like Asio sockets/streams, kioto socket/acceptor objects are **not thread-safe**. In other words, **member functions must not be called concurrently** on the same socket/acceptor from multiple threads unless you provide external synchronization.

If you drive the owning execution context from a single thread, and ensure all socket/acceptor
operations are initiated from work running on that thread, that thread acts as an
"implicit strand" (operations are serialized by construction).

This thread-safety rule is independent of how many operations may be outstanding.
The async interface supports the following **outstanding-operation** limits (Asio-style):

- **Stream sockets**: at most one outstanding read, and at most one outstanding write.
- **Allowed overlap**: you may have one read and one write outstanding at the same time.
- **Not allowed**: two reads outstanding simultaneously; likewise for writes.
- **Acceptors**: at most one outstanding `accept` / `async_accept` per acceptor.

Example: the following is **malformed** because it starts two reads without waiting for the first to complete:

```cpp
// Wrong: two reads outstanding at the same time
co_await when_all(
    sock.async_read_some(buf1),
    sock.async_read_some(buf2)
);
```

But having one read and one write outstanding is **well-formed**:

```cpp
// OK: one read + one write outstanding
co_await when_all(
    sock.async_read_some(read_buf),
    sock.async_write_some(write_buf)
);
```

If you drive an execution context from multiple threads, ensure **all initiating calls for a
given socket/acceptor are serialized** (e.g. a mutex, or funneling initiation through a single
owning thread/task).

### EOF behavior

`basic_stream_socket::read_some/async_read_some` report connection close as `kioto::error::misc_errc::eof`.

---

## 9. Synchronization primitives

Header: `#include <kioto/exec/sync_primitives.h>`

- `async_mutex`
- `async_semaphore` (and `async_binary_semaphore`)
- `async_latch`

These primitives suspend coroutines instead of blocking threads.

---

## 10. Error handling

`kioto::error::misc_errc` includes library-specific error codes.

- `eof`: end of stream

---

## 11. Thread safety (summary)

- Execution contexts: thread-safe `run/poll/get_scheduler/request_stop`.
- Sync primitives: safe across coroutines potentially running on different threads.
- `async_scope`: safe to `spawn()` from multiple threads.
- Sockets/acceptors: **not thread-safe**; do not call member functions concurrently on the same object without external synchronization. Also follow the per-object outstanding-operation limits described above.
